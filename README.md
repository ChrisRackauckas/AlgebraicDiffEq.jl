AlgebraicDiffEq.jl is a component package in the DifferentialEquations ecosystem. It holds the
differential algebraic equation solvers and utilities. While completely independent
and usable on its own, users interested in using this
functionality should check out [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl).
